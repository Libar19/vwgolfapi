# npm-vwgolfapi
NPM package for Volkswagen app API based on https://github.com/TA2k/ioBroker.vw-connect,
https://github.com/nightsha-de/npm-vwconnectapi and

This API is taken entirely from that of ADHYH. I simply modified the query interval to avoid crashes on my golf. it's only for Homebridge plugin

sudo npm install -g https://github.com/Libar19/vwgolfapi.git

to install and edit your Homebridge-weconnectid plugin
